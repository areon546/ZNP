## v0

Basic TCP server and client.

Protocol Definition:

The Client and Server talk to one another across port 8691.
Why 8691?

- See: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers>
- [Ultra Fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Fractal) seems like a cool piece of software, whilst also being rather rarely used.
